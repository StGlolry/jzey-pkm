**** Description
   Deep inside Windows lies a subsystem called the Object Manager 
   that is responsible for tracking every resource in the system.
   “Resources” can be files, Registry entries, hardware devices, running processes 
   -- essentially everything in the system that can be named and addressed.

   The object header includes items such as the object name, so that other processes 
   can reference the object by name, and a security descriptor, so that the object manager
   can control which processes access the system resource.
   The tasks that the object manager performs include the following:
   - Creating objects
   - Verifying that a process has the right to use the object
   - Creating object handles and returning them to the caller
   - Maintaining resource quotas
   - Creating duplicate handles
   - Closing handles to objects
